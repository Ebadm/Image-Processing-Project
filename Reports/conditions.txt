The code provided is for an image processing task aimed at enhancing the quality of fundus images of eyes, 
which are then passed to a pre-trained binary classifier to predict whether an eye is healthy or not. 
The images have been artificially corrupted, and my code addresses the following issues: 

1. Noise:

    denoise_image(image): This function takes an image as input and applies Non-local Means denoising for Gaussian noise and median filtering for salt/pepper noise. 
    The cv2.fastNlMeansDenoisingColored function applies non-local means denoising to the input image. 
    This method is effective in removing Gaussian noise while preserving the details in the image. 
    The cv2.medianBlur function applies a median filter to the image. This method is effective in removing salt/pepper noise in the image. 
    The function then returns the denoised image.

2.  Missing Region: 

    inpaint_missing_region(image, mask_radius=22, inpaint_radius=3): This function aims to fill in the missing circular region in the image. 
    The function first creates a black mask of the same size as the input image using np.zeros. 
    A white circle is drawn in the bottom right corner of the mask, representing the missing region to be inpainted, using cv2.circle. 
    The cv2.inpaint function performs inpainting on the input image using the mask. 
    The inpaint_radius parameter controls the size of the neighborhood around the missing region that will be inpainted. 
    The function returns the inpainted image.
    [The dimensions of the circle were taken manually running another self-written python script on the image]

3. Warping:

    unwarp_image(image): This function aims to remove the warping distortion in the image using projective transformation. 
    The function calculates the projective transformation matrix using the source and destination points of the image. 
    The source points represent the coordinates of a quadrilateral in the original image, 
    while the destination points represent the coordinates of the same quadrilateral in the output image. 
    The cv2.getPerspectiveTransform function calculates the projective transformation matrix using these points. 
    The cv2.warpPerspective function applies the projective transformation to the input image. 
    The function returns the unwarped image.

4. Contrast/Brightness:

    enhance_contrast_and_brightness(image): This function aims to improve the contrast and brightness of an input image using 
    Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). 
    The function first converts the input image from the BGR color space to the LAB color space using cv2.cvtColor. 
    Then it splits the LAB image into its individual channels (L, A, and B) using cv2.split. A CLAHE object is created using cv2.createCLAHE. 
    The clipLimit parameter controls the contrast enhancement, while the tileGridSize parameter controls the size of the grid for the histogram equalization. 
    The CLAHE object is applied to the L channel using clahe.apply. The processed L channel is then merged with the original A and B channels using cv2.merge. 
    Finally, the processed LAB image is converted back to the BGR color space using cv2.cvtColor, and the function returns the enhanced image.
