# Future Medical Data Analysis through Data Cleaning and Image Processing

## Project Overview

This project aims to harness the power of data cleaning and image processing to advance medical diagnosis assistance systems. By focusing on multimodal data, including clinical records and radiology images, the project explores innovative ways to support healthcare services.

## Background

In the digital era, healthcare services are increasingly relying on autonomous systems for knowledge extraction and decision support. This project particularly deals with medical data and fundus images from patients, focusing on the identification and analysis of Glaucoma-related patterns.

## Data and Image Processing

The project comprises two main components:

1. **Data Cleaning and Analysis**: Utilizing Python libraries such as pandas and seaborn, the clinical data of patients are cleaned and prepared for analysis. This data includes patient demographics, diagnosis information, and various ophthalmological measurements.

2. **Image Processing**: A series of fundus images undergo processing to enhance visual quality and prepare them for classification by a pre-trained AI model. Techniques applied include noise reduction, warp correction, and contrast adjustment, among others.

## Key Technologies

- **Python**: The core programming language used for data and image processing.
- **OpenCV**: An open-source library utilized for advanced image processing tasks.
- **Pandas**: A data manipulation library used to clean and prepare datasets.
- **Seaborn**: A visualization library employed to create informative graphs from data.
- **Machine Learning**: Employing pre-trained models to classify processed images.

## Visuals

The project utilizes various image processing techniques to enhance the quality of medical images, crucial for accurate diagnosis by AI systems.
